\section{INTRODUCTION}

\subsection{Purpose of this Document}
The purpose of this document is to provide robust and repeatable system tests.
They will be run in each version of the program to ensure that adequate 
functionality remains as the software is updated. Provide a outline to 
group leaders so they can estimate resources and effort required for each test
run.


\subsection{Scope}
This document covers the testing plan for the system. The tests cover all relevant functional requirements. QA Managers and Group leaders should be
up to date with this specification as they will be required to sign off
on all version changes to the system.


\subsection{Objectives}
The objectives of this document are to :
\begin{enumerate}
\item Provide Robust and repeatable system tests.
\item Provide tests for all verifiable functional requirements
\item Ensure all areas of the system work when intergrated
\item Provide Leaders with estimates for resources and effort required
for tests

\end {enumerate}
