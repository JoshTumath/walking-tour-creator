\section{Introduction}


\subsection{Purpose of this Document}

This document describes the outline design for the Software Engineering Group Project (Group 14). It should be read 
in the context of the Group Project, taking into account the details of the group project assignment and the group 
project quality assurance (QA) plan [1]<-get proper references. 


\subsection{Scope}

This document should be read by all the members of the project, expecially the Q.A Manage and Project Leader. 

It should be assumed that the re
It is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the 
QA Plan [1].


\subsection{Objectives}

The main objective of this Design Specification is to aid in the development of the prototype and final version of the software while simontaosly meeting the clients`s requirements. Doing this will allow the group to see the deisgn elements that will be used for when implementation occurs. 

redo
These will generally include the software structure, components, interfaces, and data. In 
a complete design specification, each requirement must be traceable to one or more design entities. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Decribe the main componetes of the Andriod App, database and website
\item a DEPENDENCY DESCRIPTION of what programs relie on each other
\item a INTERFACE DESCRIPTION for how everything interfaces with eachother
\end{itemize}

\section{Anatomical Description}
\subsection{Programs in WalkingTourCreator}
their is a total of 3 pprograms in the whole system:

\begin{itemize}
\item The Android App, which hosts the interface for the Picture nav
\item The Website that has the..
\item the Databse where all the information about the walks are saved
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Andriod App}

the android app isused to make walks, view walks - write what app does

 The andriod app implements the following Functional Requirements:
(FR1),(FR2),(FR4),(FR5),(FR6) and (FR9)

\subsubsection{Database(Mysql)}
blah
\subsubsection{Website }
blah
\subsection{Significant classes in each program}

\subsubsection{Significant classes Andriod}

create walk - is the main class that allows the user to create a walk
\newline
\newline upload walk - after the user is done creating a walk, the user will then have the option to upload the walk to the database


\subsubsection{Significant classes? database}
Store walk-once the user chooses to upload a walk, the server/database will store it
\newline Delete walk-only admins/owner of the walk are allowed to delete walks
\newline Browse walks(move this below)?




\subsubsection{Significant classes? website}
blah\newline Browse walks-only admins/owner of the walk are allowed to delete walks


\subsubsection{SuperClasses that are used by all, but should be none}
blah
